# TheOffice
If the Office were a call center this might be how their calls data look like. The date ranges match that of the duration of the TV show on air. The characters are pulled directly from the cast list. The department names closely mirror the actual departments in the show but some names are changed. The calls handled are arbitrarily assigned using random number generator. Although two departments are purposefully give zero for sales calls.
